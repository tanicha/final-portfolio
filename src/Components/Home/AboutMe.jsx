                        I have been coding since the start of this year (Jan 2023) - Although, I first gained some coding experience during my time in the Year Up Program (2021-2022), which was the start of my coding journey! Since the beginning, with the help of many supporting coaches/peers, I have been able to make various projects using different coding languages, frameworks, libraries, etc.
